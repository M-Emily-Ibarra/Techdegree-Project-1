			<h2>Welcome to Otaku Azucar Reviews!</h2>
			<p>Azu here! I have been watching and enjoying anime for over two decades. I understand that life gets busy and we can't always watch as much anime as we used to. There is more anime coming out now than ever before, which is amazing! However, when you have limited time you want to make sure you are ideally watching something you more likely to enjoy. Hopefully, this is where I can come in to help!</p>
			<p>Reviews are graded on charactistics that I personally have found to be the most important over the years of watching anime.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Character development</li>
				<li>Story/Pacing</li>
				<li>Animation Quality</li>
				<li>Action (if applicable)</li>
				<li>Voice Acting</li>
				<li>Misc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each of these items can be broken into more detailed commentary. For example, "Action" could include how well a fight was coreographed.</p>
