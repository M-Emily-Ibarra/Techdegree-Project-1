			<h2>Welcome to Otaku Azucar Reviews!</h2>
			<p>Azu here! I understand that life gets busy and we can't always watch as much anime as we used to. There is more anime coming out now than ever before, which is amazing! However, when you have limited time you want to make sure you are ideally watching something you more likely to enjoy. Hopefully, this is where I can come in to help!</p>

			<h3>Who is Azu?</h3>
			<p>I have been watching anime for 24 years and gone through the full cycle spectrum of enjoying every genre of anime. I found anime through friends and was immediately hooked. Where I grew up, I was fortunate to have a small comic book shop in town that carried some anime VHS tapes for rent. They would rent them for $6 for a three day period! That was a lot, but it was worth it to watch something new. When I got older, I started the anime club at my high school. I wanted to share anime with more people and have a place where likeminded students could hang out together.</p>
			<p>As an adult, I find enjoyment in discussing anime with friends and co-workers. It's fun to learn more about their tastes, what they have enjoyed in the past, and recommending new anime for them to watch. Even though I have my favorites, I try to make recommendations for them based on what I think will suit their tastes best. Which is what brings me here today!</p>

			<h3>What Makes Azu Reviews Different?</h3>
			<p>Reviews are graded on charactistics that I personally have found to be the most important over the years of watching anime. If these are qualities that you prioritize as well, then there is a good chance that you will find value in Azu Reviews.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Character development</li>
				<li>Story/Pacing</li>
				<li>Animation Quality</li>
				<li>Action (if applicable)</li>
				<li>Voice Acting</li>
				<li>Misc.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each of these items can be broken into more detailed commentary. For example, "Action" may include how well a fight was coreographed. If you prioritize other charactistics a bit differently from me, that's great too! Let's discuss and appreciate together!</p>
			<p>Lastly, there are a lot of great anime reviewers out there that I trust and respect. I hope that I can contribute by offering a unique voice that might not be available yet. Thank you for visiting Otaku Azucar!</p>
